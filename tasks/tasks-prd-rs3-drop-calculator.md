## Progress Tracking

Use this section to track overall progress:

- **Phase 1 - Foundation**: Tasks 1.0 - 5.0
- **Phase 1 - Data**: Task 6.0
- **Phase 1 - Testing**: Task 7.0

## Notes

This task list provides a comprehensive roadmap for rebuilding the RS3 Drop Rate Calculator with proper drop mechanics implementation. The tasks are structured to guide development through the entire implementation process, from data architecture to final testing.

All calculations must be validated against RS3 Wiki examples to ensure 100% accuracy.
